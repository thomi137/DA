\section{Generalisation of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation}
Equation~(\ref{eq:GrossPitaevskii}) has the form of a Schr\"odinger equation with a nonlinear distribution that takes into account the 
interactions between particles. However, as we wish to study a kicked condensate that evolves in time, we have to move to a time-dependent 
equation of motion for such a condensate.
