## Purpose
This repository comprises the source code used to simulate kicked Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a lattice with harmonic potential wells. I specifically is used to examine behaviour of the governing Gross-Pitaevskii equation on specific Kick strengths. The non-linearity implies the validity of the KAM theory of classical chaos theory.

At the time it was thought that this gives rise to chaotic behaviour in the quantum realm
